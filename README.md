# Vue + Spotify Preview

A small experiment for me to try and put together what I've learned when working with Vue.js.

[Demo](http://codepen.io/tjFogarty/pen/RrvMBO/)

I could be doing this all wrong with Vue, but I had fun doing it. Onwards and upwards!

I'm useless when it comes to design, so I took ideas from [Music Player Transition](http://www.materialup.com/posts/music-player-transition). Code for interacting with Spotify from [here](http://jsfiddle.net/JMPerez/0u0v7e1b/).
